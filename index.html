            <h3> Web Design Course </h3>
            <p> Web design software provides users the tools to <br> create, edit, and update web pages. Web <br> designers will use these programs to create a  <br> web page’s layout and content through either <br> editing HTML or a WYSIWYG editor. <br> Companies operating without a website builder <br> tool will require a designer to construct and <br> manage the HTML and CSS framework for <br> their website. These products include features <br> for editing code and visualizing projects. Many <br> will also possess frameworks and templates to <br> assist in creating the website’s basic structure, <br> as well as element libraries with templates or <br> shortcodes to save time during the design <br> process. </p>

            <h3> Mobile Application Development Programme </h3>
            <p> Mobile application development is the set of <br> processes and procedures involved in writing <br> software for small, wireless computing devices, <br> such as smartphones and other hand-held <br> devices. Like web application development, <br> mobile application development has its roots in <br> more traditional software development. One <br> critical difference, however, is that mobile apps <br> are often written specifically to take advantage <br> of the unique features of a particular mobile <br> device </p>
